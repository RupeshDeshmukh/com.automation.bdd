# Automation Using BDD - Cucumber

<p>
<ul>
<li>Behavior-Driven Development, or BDD, is a set of software engineering practices that can help your team focus their efforts on building valuable features, and help ensure that these features are well designed and well implemented.</li>
<li>It draws on Agile and Lean practices such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Domain Driven Design (DDD), and Pull-based feature definition.</li>
<li>Behavior Driven Development was originally invented by Dan North in the early to mid-2000s as an easier way to teach and to practice Test Driven Development.</li>
</ul>
