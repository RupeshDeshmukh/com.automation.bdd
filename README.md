# Automation Using BDD - Cucumber
Automation - BDD In Action

<p>
Behavior-Driven Development, or BDD, is a set of software engineering practices that can help your team focus their efforts on building valuable features, and help ensure that these features are well designed and well implemented.
It draws on Agile and Lean practices such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Domain Driven Design (DDD), and Pull-based feature definition.
Behavior Driven Development was originally invented by Dan North in the early to mid-2000s as an easier way to teach and to practice Test Driven Development.
